1) What is Selenium? What are the different Selenium components? Explain about Selenium Webdriver.
   Selenium can automate only browser application.
   Components: Selenium IDE,Selenium RC, Selenium Web driver, Selenium GRID.
   Selenium WebDriver is a collection of open source APIs which are used to automate the testing of a web application.

2) How does Selenium communicate with the Web browsers?
  Selenium Script creates an HTTP Request for each selenium command and sends it to the browser driver. 
An HTTP request is then sent to the server using Browser Driver. The steps are executed on the HTTP server. 
The execution status is sent to the HTTP server which is then captured by the automation script.

3.What are the locators available  to find an element using Selenium?
  * Id 
  * Name
  * class
  * linktext
  * Partial Link Text
  * tagname
  * CssSelector
  * xpath
4. Why ID is preferable than X-Path?
   By.ID()is the faster technique because at its root, the call goes down to document. getElementById(), which is optimized by most browsers. 
But, finding elements using XPath is better for locating elements having complex selectors, and is no doubt the most
flexible selection strategy.

5.How to select value in dropdown?
    A dropdown is represented by <select> tag and the options are represented by <option> tag. 
To select an option with its value we have to use the selectByValue method and pass the value 
attribute of the option that we want to select as a parameter to that method. 

6) What is the difference between Absolute Path and Relative Path?
*Absolute Xpath: It contains the complete path from the Root Element to the desire element.
*Relative Xpath: This is more like starting simply by referencing the element you want and go from the particular location. 
You use always the Relative Path for testing of an element.
7) How to verify if the given check box is checked or not (it is not taught but you can explore) Try here: http://leafground.com/pages/checkbox.html
  In order to check if a checkbox is checked or unchecked, we can used the isSelected() method over the checkbox element. 
The isSelected() method returns a boolean value of true if the checkbox is checked false otherwise.

8)Difference between System.setProperty and WebDriverManager
  * System.setProperty method is used to configure the browser driver path.
The Selenium client library communicates with the ChromeDriver via the JSON Wire Protocol. The Chrome browser driver 
acts like a link between the Selenium implementation code and the Chrome browser.
  * WebDriverManager automates the browser setup in the Selenium code. 
By default, it downloads the latest version of the browser binary and also the binary for the appropriate platform. 
We have to add the dependency for WebDriverManager in case the code belongs to Maven or Gradle environment.
9) Write the syntax for preceding and following x-paths.

10) How to get an attribute value using Selenium WebDriver?
   We can get the attribute of element in Selenium webdriver. 
The getAttribute() method is used to obtain the value of an attribute in an html document. 
In an html code, attribute and its value appear as a key value pair.
